NetworkX provides some basic drawing functionality that works for small graphs. 
We have selected a subset of nodes from the graph for you to practice using NetworkX's drawing facilities. 
It has been pre-loaded as T_sub.

Instructions:
-------------
Import matplotlib.pyplot as plt and networkx as nx.
Draw T_sub to the screen by using the nx.draw() function, and don't forget to also use plt.show() to display it.

script.py:
------------
# Import necessary modules
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import networkx as nx

# Draw the graph to screen
nx.draw(T_sub)
plt.show()
